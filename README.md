# Project Overview: Enhancing London's Transport Strategy
The Greater London Authority (GLA) has enlisted the expertise of ThoughtWorks to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the progress made in the transport strategy outlined for the next two decades in 2018. The Mayor of London is keen to evaluate the impact of various interventions on cycling behaviour and seeks recommendations for potential adjustments to the strategy.

# My Contribution:
+ Set up Asana for efficient project management, facilitating team collaboration and task tracking.
+ Worked closely with the team to document methodologies, data sources, and assumptions made during the analysis.
+ Ensured transparency and replicability of the research through comprehensive documentation practices.
+ Initiated the data cleaning process, focusing specifically on New York City and Sydney cycling files.
+ Led the analysis of cycling habits across NYC, London, and Sydney, providing valuable insights into behavioural patterns.

### A Pillar of Sustainable Urban Transit in New York City

Launched in May 2013, Citi Bike swiftly emerged as a cornerstone of New York City's transit system, holding the title of the largest bike share program in the U.S. Boasting a distinctive blend of convenience, affordability, and sustainability, Citi Bike has become a favored alternative for commuters. Its positive impact extends beyond mere transportation, promoting an active and healthy lifestyle while contributing significantly to the city's environmental well-being. This two-wheeled transit solution not only ensures efficient urban mobility but also fosters a culture of well-being among New Yorkers.

# Patterns, Trends, and Insights
The analysis reveals several key patterns in London's cycling landscape. Daily trends, influenced by commuting peaks, contrast with weekly declines due to perceived high effort. Monthly and seasonal variations are driven by weather conditions. London lags significantly behind New York City in cycling uptake, emphasizing the need for strategies akin to NYC's successful bike-sharing model. The correlation between cycle parking availability and cycling rates highlights the importance of enhanced infrastructure, particularly in outer areas. The COVID-19 impact signals a shift towards alternative transport, necessitating improved cycling-public transport connectivity. While 2022 saw a surge in cycling, it also underscored the urgency for enhanced road safety measures. Inner London's better infrastructure contrasts with Outer London's limited cycle lanes, emphasizing the need for improved safety measures. Socio-economic factors influence cycling trends, including bike theft and the cost-of-living crisis. 4Datalytics utilized these insights to recommend interventions to enhance cycling use in London.
