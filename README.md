# Project Overview: Enhancing London's Transport Strategy
The Greater London Authority (GLA) has enlisted the expertise of ThoughtWorks to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the progress made in the transport strategy outlined for the next two decades in 2018. The Mayor of London is keen to evaluate the impact of various interventions on cycling behaviour and seeks recommendations for potential adjustments to the strategy.

## Project Scope
As a team, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the current state of cycling in London, evaluating the effectiveness of implemented strategies and their influence on public behaviour. The study encompassed demographic profiling of cyclists and the identification of potential outreach strategies for underrepresented groups. The goal was to provide the GLA with actionable insights and recommendations for optimizing the existing transport strategy.

The collaboration between the GLA and ThoughtWorks aims to refine London's transport strategy, ensuring it aligns with evolving patterns in cycling behaviour and remains a sustainable, inclusive, and efficient mode of urban transportation.

### My Contribution:
+ Set up Asana for efficient project management, facilitating team collaboration and task tracking.
+ Worked closely with the team to document methodologies, data sources, and assumptions made during the analysis.
+ Ensured transparency and replicability of the research through comprehensive documentation practices.
+ Initiated the data cleaning process, focusing specifically on New York City and Sydney cycling files.
+ Led the analysis of cycling habits across NYC, London, and Sydney, providing valuable insights into behavioural patterns.

## Analysis Approach

Our analytical methodology employed a multifaceted approach to gain comprehensive insights:

- **Descriptive Analysis:** Utilized statistical measures and charts to assess numerical data from diverse sources, including ASHE, climate data, census, cycle flows, crime rates, and collision data.
  
- **Time-Series Analysis:** Tracked trends and patterns over time using datasets related to cycle flows, bicycle hire schemes, crime rates, cyclist collisions, and road accidents.
  
- **Regression Analysis:** Examined relationships between variables, such as analyzing the correlation between cycling behaviour and factors like weather conditions, crime rates, or demographic variables.
  
- **Correlation Analysis:** Explored correlations among different datasets to identify potential relationships or dependencies, such as examining correlations between cycling behaviour and factors like weather, crime rates, or public transport-related crimes.

## Analysis Tools and Techniques

We chose Python for this project due to its open-source nature, rich libraries supporting data analysis, visualization, and machine learning, scalability for large datasets, and versatility in handling various data types.

## Challenges Faced
While striving for a unified approach, maintaining a single Jupyter Notebook in GitHub posed challenges, leading to file corruption issues. To address this, the team developed a 'core' Jupyter Notebook with inbuilt functions and data loading. Each team member worked on individual copies, coordinating efforts in daily stand-ups to ensure synchronization.

#### A Pillar of Sustainable Urban Transit in New York City
Launched in May 2013, Citi Bike swiftly emerged as a cornerstone of New York City's transit system, holding the title of the largest bike share program in the U.S. Boasting a distinctive blend of convenience, affordability, and sustainability, Citi Bike has become a favoured alternative for commuters. Its positive impact extends beyond mere transportation, promoting an active and healthy lifestyle while contributing significantly to the city's environmental well-being. This two-wheeled transit solution not only ensures efficient urban mobility but also fosters a culture of well-being among New Yorkers.

The analysis reveals several key patterns in London's cycling landscape. Daily trends, influenced by commuting peaks, contrast with weekly declines due to perceived high effort. Monthly and seasonal variations are driven by weather conditions. London lags significantly behind New York City in cycling uptake, emphasizing the need for strategies akin to NYC's successful bike-sharing model. The correlation between cycle parking availability and cycling rates highlights the importance of enhanced infrastructure, particularly in outer areas. The COVID-19 impact signals a shift towards alternative transport, necessitating improved cycling-public transport connectivity. While 2022 saw a surge in cycling, it also underscored the urgency for enhanced road safety measures. Inner London's better infrastructure contrasts with Outer London's limited cycle lanes, emphasizing the need for improved safety measures. Socio-economic factors influence cycling trends, including bike theft and the cost-of-living crisis. 4Datalytics utilized these insights to recommend interventions to enhance cycling use in London.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, our analysis underscores substantial opportunities for advancing and enhancing London's cycling culture. Through drawing insights from successful models and implementing inclusive strategies, our team envisions the transformation of London into a more robust and inviting cycling environment.
